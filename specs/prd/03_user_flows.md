# User Flows & Wireframes

## Overview

This document serves as the master index for all user flows and wireframes in the Jabiru application. Each major feature area has been documented in detail with comprehensive flows, wireframes, and implementation notes.

The user flows are organized to cover the complete user journey from first-time experience through advanced collaboration and data management features. Each document includes mermaid diagrams, detailed wireframes, error states, mobile experiences, and success metrics.

## Key Design Principles

Across all user flows, we maintain these core principles:

1. **Speed**: First insight in under 60 seconds
2. **Intelligence**: AI understands business context
3. **Simplicity**: No technical knowledge required
4. **Collaboration**: Built for teams from the ground up
5. **Trust**: Transparent, accurate, and secure
