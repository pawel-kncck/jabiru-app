## Step 1: Initial Project Scaffolding
**Date:** 2025-07-30
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Executor:** Agent

### Actions Taken:
1. Initialized Git repository in the existing `jabiru-app` directory
2. Created directory structure:
   - `frontend/` - For React TypeScript application
   - `backend/` - For Python FastAPI application  
   - `shared/` - For shared types and utilities
3. Created root configuration files:
   - `.gitignore` - Comprehensive ignore file for Python, Node.js, and OS files
   - `README.md` - Basic project description and structure
   - `package.json` - Monorepo configuration with npm workspaces
4. Set up shared module structure:
   - `shared/package.json` - TypeScript package configuration
   - `shared/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler configuration
   - `shared/src/index.ts` - Module entry point
   - `shared/src/types.ts` - Initial shared type definitions
   - `shared/src/utils.ts` - Common utility functions
   - `shared/src/__tests__/utils.test.ts` - Unit tests for utilities

### Decisions Made:
- Used the existing `jabiru-app` directory rather than creating a new `jabiru` directory
- Configured npm workspaces for monorepo management
- Set up TypeScript for the shared module with strict mode enabled
- Added basic shared types (User, Project) and utilities (formatDate, generateId)

### Notes:
- The project name has been changed from "Impala" to "Jabiru" throughout all specifications
- Node.js version requirement set to >=18.0.0
- Ready to proceed with Step 2: Frontend React Application Setup

### Commit: `chore: initial project scaffolding and monorepo setup`

## Step 2: Frontend React Application Setup
**Date:** 2025-07-30
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Executor:** Agent & Human

### Actions Taken:
1. Navigated to `frontend/` directory
2. Initialized a new Vite React TypeScript project with `npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts`
3. Installed dependencies with `npm install`
4. Modified `App.tsx` to display "Jabiru - Data Analytics Platform"
5. Updated `index.html` title to "Jabiru"
6. Verified TypeScript strict mode is enabled in `tsconfig.app.json`
7. Successfully ran the app with `npm run dev` (app started on port 5174 as 5173 was in use)

### Technical Details:
- Vite version: 7.0.6
- React version: 18.x (latest)
- TypeScript configured with:
  - Target: ES2022
  - Strict mode: enabled
  - Module: ESNext
  - JSX: react-jsx

### Decisions Made:
- Used Vite as the build tool for fast development experience
- Kept the default TypeScript configuration with strict mode already enabled
- Simplified App.tsx to show only the platform title for now

### Notes:
- The development server runs successfully
- TypeScript strict mode is already configured by default in Vite template
- Ready to proceed with Step 3: Backend FastAPI Application Setup

### Commit: `feat: initialize React frontend with TypeScript and Vite`
