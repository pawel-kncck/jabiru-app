2. Created directory structure:
   - `frontend/` - For React TypeScript application
   - `backend/` - For Python FastAPI application  
   - `shared/` - For shared types and utilities
3. Created root configuration files:
   - `.gitignore` - Comprehensive ignore file for Python, Node.js, and OS files
   - `README.md` - Basic project description and structure
   - `package.json` - Monorepo configuration with npm workspaces
4. Set up shared module structure:
   - `shared/package.json` - TypeScript package configuration
   - `shared/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler configuration
   - `shared/src/index.ts` - Module entry point
   - `shared/src/types.ts` - Initial shared type definitions

## Step 19: CSV Parsing and Data Preview
**Date & Time:** 2025-07-30 14:05:17 (CEST)
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Executor:** Agent

### Actions Taken:
1. Added data processing dependencies:
   - pandas==2.1.3 for CSV parsing and data manipulation
   - chardet==5.2.0 for encoding detection
2. Created DataProcessingService (`backend/src/services/data_processing.py`):
   - Automatic encoding detection for CSV files
   - Delimiter detection (comma, semicolon, tab, pipe)
   - Column type detection (integer, float, string, datetime, boolean)
   - CSV parsing with error handling
   - Data preview generation (first 100 rows by default)
   - Column statistics calculation (mean, median, min, max, etc.)
   - Missing value detection and reporting
3. Added preview endpoints to files API:
   - GET /files/{file_id}/preview - Get CSV preview and metadata
   - GET /files/{file_id}/column-stats/{column_name} - Get column statistics
4. Created DataPreview component (`frontend/src/components/DataPreview.tsx`):
   - Modal interface for data preview
   - Displays file metadata (rows, columns, encoding, delimiter)
   - Data table with column type indicators
   - Click column headers for statistics
   - Visual indicators for missing values
   - Responsive design with scrollable table
5. Updated files service with preview methods:
   - getFilePreview() for retrieving preview data
   - getColumnStatistics() for column analysis
6. Enhanced ProjectDetail page:
   - Preview button for CSV files only
   - Modal display of data preview
7. Created comprehensive tests:
   - Data processing service tests with various CSV formats
   - File preview endpoint tests
   - Column statistics tests
   - Edge case handling (missing values, special characters)

### Technical Details:
- Pandas for efficient CSV processing
- Automatic delimiter and encoding detection
- Type inference for all columns
- Memory-efficient preview generation
- Real-time column statistics calculation

### Decisions Made:
- Limited preview to 100 rows for performance
- Supported multiple delimiters (comma, semicolon, tab, pipe)
- Comprehensive type detection including datetime and boolean
- Modal interface for better UX
- Column-clickable statistics for data exploration

### Notes:
- CSV parsing fully functional with various formats
- Preview provides immediate data insights
- Column statistics help understand data distribution
- Ready for canvas implementation

## Step 20: Canvas Model and Basic Structure
**Date & Time:** 2025-07-30 14:13:42 (CEST)
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Executor:** Agent

### Actions Taken:
1. Created Canvas model (`backend/src/models/canvas.py`):
   - UUID primary key
   - Name field for canvas identification
   - Project relationship (many-to-one)
   - JSON content storage for flexible block structure
   - Creator relationship to User
   - Timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at)
2. Updated relationships in existing models:
   - Added `canvases` relationship to Project model
   - Added `created_canvases` relationship to User model
3. Created canvas schemas (`backend/src/schemas/canvas.py`):
   - CanvasCreate for new canvas creation
   - CanvasUpdate for partial updates
   - Canvas response schema
   - CanvasList for paginated results
4. Implemented canvas endpoints (`backend/src/api/v1/endpoints/canvases.py`):
   - POST /projects/{project_id}/canvases - Create canvas
   - GET /projects/{project_id}/canvases - List project canvases
   - GET /canvases/{canvas_id} - Get specific canvas
   - PUT /canvases/{canvas_id} - Update canvas
   - DELETE /canvases/{canvas_id} - Delete canvas
5. Generated and applied database migration:
   - Created canvases table with proper relationships
   - Fixed GUID type imports in migration
6. Created comprehensive tests (`backend/tests/test_canvas_endpoints.py`):
   - Canvas CRUD operations
   - Authorization checks
   - Project isolation
7. Created canvas service (`frontend/src/services/canvas.ts`):
   - Full CRUD operations
   - Helper for auto-saving canvas content
   - Type-safe interfaces
8. Enhanced ProjectDetail page:
   - Canvas listing section
   - Create new canvas form
   - Canvas cards with metadata
   - Delete functionality
   - Navigation to canvas editor
9. Added comprehensive CSS styling:
   - Canvas grid layout
   - Canvas cards
   - Form styling
   - Button variants

### Technical Details:
- JSON field for flexible content storage
- Default content structure with blocks array and version
- Cascade delete with projects
- Owner-based access control
- RESTful API design

### Decisions Made:
- JSON storage for maximum flexibility
- Version field in content for future migrations
- Canvas tied to projects for organization
- Simple name-based identification

### Notes:
- Canvas infrastructure fully functional
- Ready for canvas editor implementation
- All tests passing
- Foundation for visual analytics workspace

### Commit: `feat: add Canvas model with basic CRUD operations`
