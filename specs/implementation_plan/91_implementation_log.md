## Step 1: Initial Project Scaffolding
**Date:** 2025-07-30
**Status:** âœ… Completed
**Executor:** Agent

### Actions Taken:
1. Initialized Git repository in the existing `jabiru-app` directory
2. Created directory structure:
   - `frontend/` - For React TypeScript application
   - `backend/` - For Python FastAPI application  
   - `shared/` - For shared types and utilities
3. Created root configuration files:
   - `.gitignore` - Comprehensive ignore file for Python, Node.js, and OS files
   - `README.md` - Basic project description and structure
   - `package.json` - Monorepo configuration with npm workspaces
4. Set up shared module structure:
   - `shared/package.json` - TypeScript package configuration
   - `shared/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler configuration
   - `shared/src/index.ts` - Module entry point
   - `shared/src/types.ts` - Initial shared type definitions
   - `shared/src/utils.ts` - Common utility functions
   - `shared/src/__tests__/utils.test.ts` - Unit tests for utilities

### Decisions Made:
- Used the existing `jabiru-app` directory rather than creating a new `jabiru` directory
- Configured npm workspaces for monorepo management
- Set up TypeScript for the shared module with strict mode enabled
- Added basic shared types (User, Project) and utilities (formatDate, generateId)

### Notes:
- The project name has been changed from "Impala" to "Jabiru" throughout all specifications
- Node.js version requirement set to >=18.0.0
- Ready to proceed with Step 2: Frontend React Application Setup

### Commit: `chore: initial project scaffolding and monorepo setup`
