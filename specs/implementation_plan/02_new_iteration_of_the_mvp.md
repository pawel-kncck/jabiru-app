Of course. Here is the summary of the new implementation plan in Markdown format:

### **Jabiru App: Phased MVP Implementation Plan**

#### **Document Purpose & Context**

This document outlines the revised, agile implementation plan for the Jabiru application. The strategy pivots from a linear, feature-based roadmap to an iterative, five-phase approach focused on rapidly developing and testing the core value proposition: **providing users with an AI-powered data analysis environment that understands the context of their data.**

The plan prioritizes the creation of a minimal, yet functional, product that can be tested by users at an early stage. It de-risks the project by deferring complex UI elements (like the original Canvas editor) in favor of a familiar and intuitive chat-based interface.

#### **Core User Flows (MVP Focus)**

The entire MVP development will be centered around three core, interconnected user flows:

1.  **Data Management & Preparation (The "Data Studio"):** The user's ability to upload, preview, and manage their data files within a specific project. This is the foundation of the entire application.
2.  **Context Definition:** The user's ability to provide crucial business and project-level context. This context is the "secret sauce" that will enable the AI to provide more relevant and insightful analysis than a generic LLM.
3.  **Conversational Analysis (The "Chat"):** The user's primary interface for interacting with the AI. This is where they will ask questions, request analysis, and receive insights about their data.

### **The Five Phases of Development**

#### **Phase 1: "Ugly Duckling" - Foundational UI/UX**

- **Objective:** To create a clean, functional, and scalable UI foundation that replaces the existing complex and buggy interface. The aesthetic will be minimalistic, inspired by modern LLM chat applications.
- **Key Features & User Experience:**
  - **Simplified Layout:** A two-column layout featuring a collapsible sidebar for project navigation and a main content area.
  - **Project-Centric View:** A single view with three tabs: "Data Studio," "Context," and "Chat."
  - **Minimalist Authentication:** Functional login/registration flows.
  - **User Flow:** Login -> Select/Create Project -> View Project with placeholder tabs.

#### **Phase 2: "Baby Shark" - Core Functionality & First Testable Version**

- **Objective:** To implement the minimum backend functionality to make the UI interactive and create the first testable product.
- **Key Features & User Experience:**
  - **Robust Data Upload:** The "Data Studio" tab becomes functional (file upload, list, bug fixes).
  - **Context Persistence:** The "Context" tab allows users to save project context to the database.
  - **Basic Chat Interface:** The "Chat" tab sends user messages + saved context to a standard LLM. The AI does not yet access the data file itself.
  - **User Flow:** Select Project -> Upload CSV -> Save Context -> Ask the AI a question related to the context.

#### **Phase 3: "Growing Panda" - Data Intelligence & Core Value**

- **Objective:** To implement the core value proposition: the AI's ability to perform data analysis.
- **Key Features & User Experience:**
  - **Secure Backend API:** A new, private API is created to handle data processing and code execution.
  - **Pandas Integration:** The API can execute Python/Pandas scripts.
  - **Chat-Driven Analysis:** The AI can now interpret natural language, translate it to Pandas code, and execute it against user data.
  - **Cost & Token Tracking:** Backend monitoring is implemented.
  - **User Flow:** Ask specific questions about the uploaded data (e.g., "What is the total of the 'QTY' column?") and receive results (like a formatted table) in the chat.

#### **Phase 4: "Mysterious Owl" - Differentiated & Proactive Features**

- **Objective:** To deliver unique, proactive insights that go beyond generic code interpreters.
- **Key Features & User Experience:**
  - **Smart Context Generation:** The AI suggests a draft context after data upload.
  - **Automated Insights:** The AI proactively finds patterns and anomalies.
  - **Hypothesis Generation:** The system can generate testable hypotheses from the data.
  - **Basic Visualization:** The AI can generate and display static charts as images in the chat.
  - **User Flow:** Upload data -> Get auto-generated context -> AI proactively points out an interesting trend -> User asks for a chart and receives it as an image.

#### **Phase 5: MVP Deployment**

- **Objective:** To make the mature product publicly available.
- **Key Features & User Experience:**
  - **Cloud Deployment:** The application is deployed to a scalable cloud infrastructure.
  - **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated testing and release pipelines are established.
  - **User Onboarding:** A polished first-time user experience and tutorial are created.
  - **User Flow:** New user signs up online -> Is guided through a tutorial -> Uses the full application in a live environment.
